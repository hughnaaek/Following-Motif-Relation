# Under construction
# Following-Motif-Relation

Given two time series, with one containing a motif that leads the motif pattern in the other, our goal is to identify which time series leads or follows, and to predict the motif-following time steps in both series.

## EXAMPLE 
```python
# Your Python code here
print("Hello, World!")
```
